# LC-3-virtual-machine
Emulator for the LC-3 VM, allowing you to execute LC-3 machine code programs.
To execute this program, you need to compile it using a C compiler, such as GCC. Save the code in a file, for example, "lc3.c", and then open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is located. Use the following command to compile the program:
gcc -o lc3 lc3.c;
./lc3 program.
Replace <program> with the path to an LC-3 machine code program that you want to execute. You can use LC-3 assembly language to write your own programs or find existing LC-3 programs online to test with the emulator or execute the given .obj files like 2048 and rogue.
